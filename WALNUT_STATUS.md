- [ ] Deploy to production if validation passes

## Next Phase: Admin Panel Development
**Timeline**: 4 days (June 27-30)  
**Status**: PENDING (after data migration completion)

### Admin Panel Features Planned
- [ ] Tool management interface (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Bulk tool operations and data import/export
- [ ] Member administration dashboard
- [ ] Usage analytics and reporting system
- [ ] System monitoring and health dashboard

## Dependencies & Coordination

### Outbound Dependencies (What others need from WALNUT)
- **IRONWOOD**: Clean tool data for search indexing
- **ACACIA**: Updated database schema for user management
- **ROSEWOOD**: Migration completion for full system testing

### Inbound Dependencies (What WALNUT needs from others)
- **IRONWOOD**: Frontend components for admin interface
- **ACACIA**: User authentication for admin access
- **ROSEWOOD**: Test coverage for migration scripts

## Blockers & Issues
**Current Blockers**: None  
**Risks Identified**:
- Source data quality unknown until analysis complete
- Migration timeline depends on data volume and complexity
- Schema changes may require coordination with other agents

## Integration Points

### API Changes This Sprint
- **New Endpoints**: Tool management CRUD operations
- **Schema Updates**: Extended tool metadata fields
- **Migration Endpoints**: Data import/export interfaces

### Database Changes
- **New Tables**: Tool categories, metadata extensions
- **Schema Updates**: Additional tool fields for rich data
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization for search queries

## Communication Schedule
- **Daily Status Update**: Every morning at 09:00 local time
- **Blocker Escalation**: Immediate update to coordination file
- **Integration Sync**: Coordinate API changes with IRONWOOD before implementation
- **Weekly Summary**: Every Friday with sprint progress and next week planning

## Development Environment
- **Primary Node**: WALNUT (192.168.1.27)
- **Docker Swarm**: Manager role, handles production deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL primary instance
- **Storage**: `/rust/containers/` for shared migration data

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Run data source analysis
2. **Today**: Review analysis results and plan transformation approach
3. **Tomorrow**: Begin migration script development
4. **This Week**: Complete data migration preparation and testing
