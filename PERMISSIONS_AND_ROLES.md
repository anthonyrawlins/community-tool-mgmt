## 🔐 Suggested System-wide Enhancements

### 🔄 **Role Inheritance (Already Partially Designed)**

Your current role model is hierarchical, which is excellent. Consider formalizing inheritance logic:

* Non-member → Member → Volunteer → Librarian → Curator → Principal

### 🧩 **Custom Role Templates (Advanced)**

Allow Principals to define **custom roles** by toggling specific permissions, e.g.:

* `Junior Librarian` (can loan, but not delete reservations)
* `Sales Only` (view tools, record sales only)

### 📋 **Audit Logging**

Every significant action (especially from Principal, Curator, Librarian) should be logged:

* Who changed what, when, and why
* Access logs
* Loan overrides
* Tool status changes

### 📊 **Dashboard Widgets by Role**

Each role should have a tailored dashboard:

* Librarians see check-ins/outs
* Curators see catalog stats
* Principals see usage + system health
* Maintenance sees pending repair tickets

### 🧪 **Role Testing or Preview Mode**

Let a Principal or Developer “preview” the site as if they had another role (without changing users).

### 🔁 **Impersonation / Shadow Login**

Safe way to log in as another user for support/debugging (Principal-only).

### 🛡 **Security Considerations**

* Role-based access should be enforced both frontend *and* backend (server-side checks)
* Consider MFA for admin-level users
* Session timeout for Librarians or above



🔍 Explanation
inherits defines role hierarchy and simplifies permission management (e.g., librarian inherits volunteer).

permissions are structured as module:action to make it easier to group and test access at runtime.

You can enforce these with middleware, route guards, or decorators, e.g., @requires_permission('loan:create').

🛠️ Tips for Implementation
Backend
When loading a user's permissions:

Resolve all inherited roles recursively.

Merge their permissions.

Cache this result for performance.
