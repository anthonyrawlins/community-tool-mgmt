# Ballarat Tool Library - Backend Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

The IRONWOOD Agent has successfully created a comprehensive backend foundation for the Ballarat Tool Library project - a community tool lending management system with Australian GST compliance, membership tiers, and complete audit trails.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design Summary

### Core Tables & Relationships

- **users**: Core user authentication and profile data
- **members**: Membership information with tiers (Basic $55/Premium $70 + GST)
- Supports roles: MEMBER, VOLUNTEER, ADMIN

#### Tool Management
- **tools**: Complete tool catalog with barcode/serial tracking
- **tool_categories**: Hierarchical categorization system
- **maintenance_records**: Tool service and repair history
- Conditions: EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, NEEDS_REPAIR, OUT_OF_SERVICE
- Status: AVAILABLE, CHECKED_OUT, RESERVED, MAINTENANCE, RETIRED

#### Lending System
- **loans**: Check-out/return tracking with due dates and fees
- **reservations**: Tool booking system with conflict detection
- **payments**: Membership fees and penalties with Stripe integration

#### Audit & Configuration
- **audit_logs**: Complete operation tracking for compliance
- **system_config**: Configurable business rules and settings

### Key Features Implemented

#### Australian Business Compliance
- ‚úÖ 10% GST automatically calculated on all fees
- ‚úÖ Membership tiers: Basic ($60.50 total) / Premium ($77.00 total)
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail for financial tracking
- ‚úÖ Late fee system ($2/day configurable)

#### Security & Authentication

- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Input validation with Zod schemas

#### Business Logic
- ‚úÖ Membership limits: Basic (3 loans/2 reservations), Premium (5 loans/4 reservations)
- ‚úÖ Tool availability conflict detection
- ‚úÖ Automatic status updates (loans ‚Üí tool status)
- ‚úÖ Late fee calculation and damage tracking
- ‚úÖ Reservation system with date validation
