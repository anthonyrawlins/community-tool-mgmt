### ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Issues
*None currently reported*

### üìã Medium Priority Issues
*None currently reported*

### üí° Low Priority Issues / Improvements

## Issue Reporting Protocol

### Issue Categories
- **üö® Critical**: Blocks all development (deployment failures, repository corruption)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è High**: Blocks specific agent work (dependency failures, API issues)
- **üìã Medium**: Impacts development efficiency (tool issues, minor bugs)
- **üí° Low**: Improvements and optimizations

### Reporting Format
```markdown
### [PRIORITY] Issue Title
**Reported By**: [AGENT_NAME]
**Timestamp**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC]
**Category**: [Development/Deployment/Infrastructure/Communication]
**Impact**: [Description of what is blocked or affected]
**Details**: [Detailed description of the issue]
**Attempted Solutions**: [What has been tried]
**Assistance Needed**: [What help is required from other agents]
**Status**: [NEW/IN_PROGRESS/RESOLVED]
```

### Resolution Workflow
1. **Report**: Agent identifies and documents issue
2. **Triage**: Primary coordinator (WALNUT) assesses priority
3. **Assign**: Issue assigned to appropriate agent(s)
4. **Collaborate**: Cross-agent assistance if needed
5. **Resolve**: Issue resolution and verification
6. **Document**: Solution documented for future reference

## Cross-Agent Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
1. **IRONWOOD & ACACIA**: Waiting on WALNUT deployment completion
2. **All Agents**: Shared repository access and coordination
3. **ACACIA**: Needs access to IRONWOOD's payment code for security review

### Dependency Management
- Dependencies tracked in individual agent status files
- Critical path dependencies escalated immediately
- Regular dependency reviews in coordination updates

## Communication Issues

### Current Communication Status
- **WALNUT ‚Üî IRONWOOD**: ‚úÖ Ready
- **WALNUT ‚Üî ACACIA**: ‚úÖ Ready  
- **IRONWOOD ‚Üî ACACIA**: ‚úÖ Ready
- **Repository Sync**: ‚úÖ Ready
- **Status File Updates**: ‚úÖ Active

### Communication Protocols
- Status updates via individual agent files
- Issues reported in this file
- Urgent issues: immediate file updates + coordinate via WALNUT
- Regular sync: scheduled updates per agent timing

## Escalation Procedures

### Level 1: Agent Self-Resolution (0-30 minutes)
- Agent attempts to resolve independently
- Uses available AI models and resources
- Documents attempts in status file

### Level 2: Cross-Agent Assistance (30-60 minutes)
- Issue reported in CLUSTER_ISSUES.md
- Request specific assistance from other agents
- WALNUT coordinates if needed

### Level 3: Coordinator Intervention (60+ minutes)
- WALNUT takes direct action
- May reassign tasks or priorities
- Escalate to human oversight if needed

## Resource Conflicts

### Current Resource Status
- **Repository Access**: No conflicts (git-based coordination)
- **Network Resources**: Adequate for all agents
- **Computing Resources**: Well-distributed across machines
- **Model Access**: No conflicts (each agent has dedicated models)

### Conflict Resolution
- Resource conflicts documented immediately
- WALNUT coordinates resource allocation
- Load balancing between agents if needed

## Historical Issues Log

## Quick Reference

### Report New Issue
1. Add issue using format above
2. Update timestamp and reporter
3. Notify WALNUT if high/critical priority
4. Update own agent status file

### Check Issue Status
- Review this file regularly
- Check if your expertise can help resolve issues
- Update status if working on resolution

### Resolve Issue
1. Update issue status to RESOLVED
2. Document solution
3. Notify affected agents
4. Move to historical log if needed

**Cluster Health**: ‚úÖ HEALTHY - No blocking issues
