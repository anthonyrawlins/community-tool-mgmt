   - Status: [x] COMPLETED

### Priority 2: Tool Catalog Integration (Post-Deployment)
**Model**: qwen2.5-coder
**Timeline**: 2-4 hours after deployment stable

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Complete `src/app/catalog/page.tsx` API integration
- [ ] Implement real-time search functionality
- [ ] Create tool detail pages (`src/app/catalog/[id]/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Add pagination for large inventories
- [ ] Backend API connection verification

### Priority 3: Admin Panel Implementation (Post-Deployment)
**Model**: devstral
**Timeline**: 4-6 hours after deployment stable

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Build `src/app/admin/page.tsx` main interface
- [ ] Tool inventory CRUD operations
- [ ] Member management system
- [ ] Financial reporting with GST compliance
- [ ] System configuration management

## Coordination Responsibilities
As primary coordinator:
- [ ] Monitor overall cluster progress
- [ ] Coordinate with IRONWOOD and ACACIA
- [ ] Manage git repository and deployments
- [ ] Update cluster status every 30 minutes
- [ ] Escalate issues that block other agents

## Communication Schedule
- **Status Updates**: Every 30 minutes during deployment
- **Coordination Check**: Every hour with other agents
- **Issue Reporting**: Immediate for blockers
- **Phase Transitions**: Coordinate all agent transitions

## Environment Status
- **Docker Swarm**: âœ… Manager role active
- **Repository Access**: âœ… Local clone ready
- **Network Access**: âœ… Can reach IRONWOOD and ACACIA
- **Deployment Target**: ðŸ”„ tools.home.deepblack.cloud (fixing)

## Next Actions (Immediate)
1. Diagnose Docker build issues in docker-compose.swarm.yml
2. Fix image building and deployment configuration
3. Configure Traefik routing for tools.home.deepblack.cloud
4. Setup secrets and database connections
5. Verify deployment health and basic functionality

## Success Criteria - Current Phase
- [ ] tools.home.deepblack.cloud accessible
- [ ] All Docker services running stable
- [ ] Health endpoints responding
- [ ] Database connected and operational
- [ ] Ready to coordinate parallel development

## Blocking Issues
None currently - deployment fix is critical path for entire cluster.

## Resource Utilization
- **Current**: 100% deployment focus
- **Post-Deployment**: 60% development, 40% coordination
