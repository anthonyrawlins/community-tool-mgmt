## ToolLibrary Development Project

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-20 15:00:00 UTC
**Overall Status**: ‚úÖ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
**Priority**: URGENT - Deploy immediately to unblock cluster

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Deployment Ready
**Objective**: Deploy to tools.home.deepblack.cloud 
**Lead Agent**: WALNUT
**Timeline**: 15-30 minutes (READY TO DEPLOY)

## Agent Status Summary

### WALNUT (192.168.1.27) - PRIMARY COORDINATOR

**Next Tasks**: Tool catalog integration, admin panel

**Progress**:
- [x] Coordination system initialized
- [x] Docker build issues diagnosed and fixed
- [x] Deployment configuration fixed
- [x] Health checks configured
- [x] Secret management implemented
- [ ] Deploy to WALNUT Docker Swarm
- [ ] Verify deployment success

### IRONWOOD (192.168.1.113) - FEATURE DEVELOPER
**Status**: ‚è≥ STANDBY - Awaiting deployment completion
**Role**: Member dashboard + payment integration
**Models**: deepseek-coder-v2, deepseek-r1 (+ 10 others)
**Current Task**: Environment preparation
**Next Tasks**: Member dashboard, Stripe integration

**Preparation**:
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Repository cloned and configured
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Ready for parallel development

### ACACIA (192.168.1.72) - QA & SECURITY
**Status**: ‚è≥ STANDBY - Awaiting deployment completion
**Role**: Testing, security, advanced search
**Models**: starcoder2:15b, deepseek-r1 (+ 4 others)
**Current Task**: Security audit preparation
**Next Tasks**: Search enhancement, security testing

**Preparation**:
- [ ] Testing framework setup
- [ ] Security audit tools prepared
- [ ] Code review protocols established
- [ ] Ready for quality assurance

## Critical Path & Dependencies

### Immediate Priority (WALNUT)
1. **Docker Build Fix** - Resolve image build issues
   - Issue: Dockerfile configuration problems
   - Impact: Blocks entire deployment
   - ETA: 30-60 minutes

2. **Traefik Configuration** - Fix routing and SSL
   - Issue: Network configuration for tools.home.deepblack.cloud
   - Impact: Prevents public access
   - ETA: 15-30 minutes

3. **Database Initialization** - Ensure PostgreSQL setup
   - Issue: Database connection and migrations
   - Impact: Backend API non-functional
   - ETA: 15-30 minutes

### Parallel Development (Post-Deployment)
Once deployment is stable:
- **WALNUT**: Tool catalog API integration
- **IRONWOOD**: Member dashboard development
- **ACACIA**: Security audit and testing framework

## Communication Protocol Status
- **Primary Coordinator**: WALNUT (active)
- **Status Updates**: Every 30 minutes during deployment phase
- **Issue Reporting**: CLUSTER_ISSUES.md (ready)
- **Sync Protocol**: Git-based with status file updates

## Resource Allocation
- **WALNUT**: 100% deployment focus until stable
- **IRONWOOD**: Environment prep, ready for parallel work
- **ACACIA**: QA preparation, ready for testing

## Risk Assessment
‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**: Deployment blocking entire development workflow
‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**: Parallel development synchronization complexity
‚úÖ **LOW**: Individual feature development once deployment stable

## Success Criteria - Phase 1
- [ ] https://tools.home.deepblack.cloud accessible
- [ ] Health endpoints responding
- [ ] Database connected and migrated
- [ ] Basic authentication working
- [ ] All Docker services running

## Next Coordination Point
**When**: Deployment success OR 2 hours elapsed
**Action**: Move to Phase 2 (Parallel Development) OR escalate deployment issues
**Communication**: Update all agent status files
