- Saved search functionality

**Requirements**:
- Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL full-text search
- Smart categorization and tagging
- Availability prediction based on historical data
- Personalized tool recommendations

### 5. Payment Integration Completion (IRONWOOD - deepseek-r1)
**Task**: Complete Stripe integration with Australian GST
**Files to work on**:
- `backend/src/controllers/paymentController.ts` - Enhance Stripe integration
- `backend/src/services/gstService.ts` - Australian tax calculations

- PWA configuration files
- Push notification setup

**Requirements**:
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Progressive Web App functionality
- Push notifications for due dates and reservations
- Offline mode for basic functionality

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
cd community-tool-mgmt

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run dev

# Frontend setup (new terminal)
cd ..
npm install  
npm run dev
```

### 2. Task Assignment Strategy
- **WALNUT (28 models)**: Primary development, complex features
- **IRONWOOD (12 models)**: Secondary development, API integration
- **ACACIA (6+ models)**: Code review, optimization, testing

### 3. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new backend endpoints
- Integration tests for payment flows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing with large tool inventories

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier formatting
- Prisma schema validation
- Security audit for payment flows

## Deployment Notes

After development completion:
1. Update secrets in `secrets/` directory
2. Run `./deploy-swarm.sh` to deploy to Docker Swarm
3. Access at `https://tools.home.deepblack.cloud`
4. Monitor with `docker stack ps ballarat-tools`

## Priority Order
1. Tool Catalog Integration (immediate user value)
2. Member Dashboard (user engagement)
3. Admin Panel (operational efficiency)  
4. Enhanced Search (advanced features)
5. Payment Integration (monetization)
6. Mobile/PWA (accessibility)

Each task can be worked on independently by different agents in the cluster.
